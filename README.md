# OBSOLETE â€” Upstreaming into Ansible itself

This repository is **no longer maintained**.
Instead, most of this functionality was upsteamed into <https://github.com/ansible/ansible>.
If you want to contribute, please send PRs to Ansible itself (and we'll help review).

As a result of the upstream reviews, the new modules in Ansible have different interface, so you'll need to rewrite your playbooks.
There is no clear plan for smooth transition or mixed usage; see https://github.com/dkorn/manageiq-ansible-module/issues/85 for the main differences.
Don't hesitate to ask questions - on that issue, on <http://talk.manageiq.org/> and chat <https://gitter.im/ManageIQ/api>.

## The Modules

### manageiq_provider module

**Upstream replacement:** https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/module_docs/manageiq_provider_module.html

The `manageiq_provider` module currently supports adding, updating and deleting OpenShift, Amazon EC2 and Hawkular Datawarehouse providers to manageiq.  
Example playbooks [add_openshift_provider.yml](examples/add_openshift_provider.yml), [add_amazon_provider.yml](examples/add_amazon_provider.yml) and [add_hawkular_datawarehouse_provider.yml](examples/add_hawkular_datawarehouse_provider.yml) are provided.
To update an existing provider pass the changed values together with the required parameters. To delete a provider change `state=absent`.  
SSL verification for HTTPS requests between ManageIQ and the provider is enabled by default. To ignore pass `provider_verify_ssl: false`.
To use a self-signed certificate pass: `provider_ca_path: '/path/to/certfile'`. To remove a previously defined ca pass `""` (empty string). In case the parameter is passed with null or omitted the `certificate_authority` field will be left unmodified (unset on creation). `provider_ca_path` must be omitted with ManageIQ Euwe / CFME 5.7 or earlier releases.
After addition or update, each endpoint authentication is validated, a process which can take up to 50 seconds before timeout.
If all authentications are valid the provider's inventory is refreshed.
